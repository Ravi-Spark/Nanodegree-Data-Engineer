 **Project:**   Data Modeling with Cassandra
 
 
**Overview :**
In this project, we do data modeling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, we will need to model data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. we are provided with part of the ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.
